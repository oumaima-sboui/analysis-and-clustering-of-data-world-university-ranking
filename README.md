## General info
This project aims to explore and anlyse data and  then perform some clustering algorithms and evaluate them.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* python 3.+(in my case 3.7)
* jupyter or colab notebook
* differents libraries (show code)

## Steps
### EDA(expaporatory data analysis) : [click here to view the code](https://github.com/oumaima-sboui/analysis-and-clustering-of-data-world-university-ranking/blob/master/DATA_VIZ%26ANALYSIS.ipynb) 
 the data , we use , is the World University Ranking which aims to investigate the best universities in the world and since we are dealing with many variables at the same time ==>  we are processing a  <b>multivariate exploratory analysis</b>.   
When doing any data analysis it is important to understand first as much about the meaning of the data as possible.For that, we start by 
* undrestand  the data
* prepare the data
* cleaning and pretraitement of data (dealing with missing values, ...)
* show the features, the correlation between them, in differents diagrams ,tables, plots
* extracts insights 

### Perform clustring algorithms : [click here to view the code](https://github.com/oumaima-sboui/analysis-and-clustering-of-data-world-university-ranking/blob/master/Data_clustering_university_rank.ipynb) 

Clustering is an unsupervised learning method which groupe unlabeled examples.
it's the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups. It is basically a collection of objects on the basis of similarity and dissimilarity between them.[(For more click here)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clustering-in-machine-learning/).
We follow the steps below :
* carry out 4 approaches of clustering : k-means , Affinity Propagation , DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering.
* evaluate them by the measurement of metrics.
